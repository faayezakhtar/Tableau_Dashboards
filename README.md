# Tableau_Dashboards
Dashboards I created for Tableau practice and exploration
1. Revenue Analysis Dashboard - Unfortunately, I couldn't publish it so the filters aren't accessible.
   I made this dashboard with the assumption that the client's problem was that profits had fallen and they wanted to identify the cause. 
   Profitability depends on revenue and costs. This dashboard explores the revenue bucker.
   Under revenue, I use the Superstore data to explore the sales by region ad sales by quarter to identify any changes in demand over time or    over a specific geographical region. The scatterplot explores whether changes in discount have heavily impacted sales or not.
